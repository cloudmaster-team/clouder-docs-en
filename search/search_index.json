In the current version of the product you need to fill in the information on both steps, even if you do not plan to use the Coster module. The standard authorization model in Cloud Director requires connection addres (URL), organization name in Cloud Director and account details. Rights Account will require at least following rights in Cloud Director: ADMINISTRATION \u2192 General \u2192 Administrator View ACCESS CONTROL \u2192 Organization \u2192 View Organizations COMPUTE \u2192 Organization VDC \u2192 View Disk Properties LIBRARIES \u2192 Catalog \u2192 View Private and Shared Catalogs within Current Organization This is the least set of rights for reading, for the full list of rights please ask Clouder support team.

If the connection was successful, the second step will open. In the form that opens, you must fill in the data: price per core CPU in the runnig machine per day, price per GB of RAM in the running machine per day, price per GB of storage attached to the running machine per day. Prices are specified in the tenant's currency. Currency is set up when tenant is created by Astrokite team. Clouder and Coster modules can differentiate Cloud Director storage policy. At the second step of this wizard, you have the option to add the storage policy type manually - fill in the name, which should exactly match the name on the Cloud Director side, or request the data from the provider. When requesting data from the provider, Astrokite will automatically fetch the drive types from Cloud Director. Price values for each storage type will be used by Coster. If you are not planning to use Coster just enter random values. Clouder allows you to set the maximum storage size of each storage type. These limits will prevent creation of the subscriptions that are over the existing space in your cloud.
